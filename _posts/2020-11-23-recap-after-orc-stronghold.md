As the cart returned to the small cabin, the party and Havrin rest. Shield-Bearer spoke with Havrin to see if he had seen a particular symbol, the dwarf doesn't recall such a symbol and goes to sleep.

Wolf in the dark expanse grieves over the monastery, his only home been attacked by orcs and burning with his teachers and fellow students strewn on the floors of the once peaceful training grounds. A figure, clad in black calls to Wolf. Looking up the looming figure with cold blue orbs of light for eyes,  he asks why they insist on calling him "Theron." "Well, it is the name given at your birth," the tall shadow recalled. Wanting to know more from this avatar of death, Wolf pleaded it to stay, but it was all in vain.

The sun dawned and Havrin inspects the house; he finds that the basement trapdoor was been tampered with and questions Shield, Ki, and Rhogar about the lockboxes wrapped in chains. Ki reluctantly hands the Portable Hole to Shield-Bearer, saying he knows that he'll "do the right thing." After revealing that two of the boxes are in the Portable Hole, they unfold it on the floor of the cabin. When the Hole materialized, they hear the sound of coins moving, Shield-Bearer gazes in and sees that the mysterious humanoid skeleton is now upright and decaying. The undead then crawled out and both the party and Havrin stand ready to fight. After a blow of Divine Smite, the undead abomination falls. Havrin calls Shield-Bearer to a private conversation in the kitchen and motions to the basement. Rhogar tries to cover for Ki as he tries to listen in on Shield-Bearer's talk, but sounds close to having a conversation with split-personality with himself. Sneakily, Ki listens in from the opening to the cellar below.

After Havrin and Sheild-Bearer finished with Ki scurrying away to avoid getting caught, Havrin demonstrates the silver rod to Ki. He explains it to be a musket that uses black explosive powder to fire small lead balls at the target. He explains that only in dire situations, ball bearings could be used as ammo. As the perfected powder is from the Astral Plain, Havrin explains the certain dangers of the Astral Realm and the possibility of opening the Portable Hole. The party and Havrin then part ways, heading full speed to where Serina was last before they were ambushed by orcs.

Heading Northwest, Shield-Bearer pulls the cart with Wolf's corpse wrapped in (clean) bed sheets, towards a Temple of Lathander in hope to resurrect the monk. Traveling, the party comes a wooden bridge that was once used by Xandria for trade, they see that said bridge has been neglected as the water slowly eats into the wooden beams.

At the end of a day's travel, the capital, Crago lies 84 miles away, with a deviating path to the Sacred Boulder Monastery 76 miles away. Choosing to reach Crago, they keep walking until nightfall. Shield-Bearer performs *ceremony* to stave off the effects of death on Wolf, as Ki and Rhogar decide to indulge in some drinking.

After a few sips, both Rhogar and Ki are charmed by the Elvish wine and partake in more merry drinking with their new best friend the wine.

After a period of silence, Wolf tries to leave the realm as the hooded figure did. After successfully doing so, he appears in the cart above his body. Looking over at the party next to a campfire, Wolf sees a specter berating Kharghis to listen and look at him. After calling out to the spirit, Wolf learns that the spirit, Patric Clawwind, has been following the party for a couple weeks since Xandria. He says that he is involuntarily following the party due to an object from Emberwatch is tying him to the material plain. Wolf sluggishly flies over to Kharghis to attempt contact.
